The year is 2153. Life in Singapore still looks the same as before in 2020, when the virus attacked us. Maybe it is partly because nobody bothered to do anything. There were no flying cars, no hoverboards, no floating islands, no iPhone 30 and no PS10. It still look like the same thing with the skyscrapers, cars on the roads, planes in the skies and ships in the water. Nobody invented or researched something new to help society as they were just obsessed with making money. Thus, society remained the same.
 Anyway, I digress. I am just a young student named Percy and I am tasked to write how life is like in 2153. This is my weighted assessment and I must score well with this essay. I am supposed to be writing to a student of my age in 2020. That would be you, I suppose. 
 Let us start with the history of what happened in 2020. In 2019, the virus attacked Earth. In 2020, the brave citizens of 2020 were forced to battle the virus with masks and hand sanitisers. They fought the virus for 10 years. In 2030, they developed new medication that will rid the virus of the body immediately. They were given out for free and the virus was wiped out. However, that was not the end of trouble for the 21st century. In 2042, the World Internet War began. As a student in 2020, you might wonder how one can fight a war in the Internet. It was very possible. Information was being leaked everywhere with nobody knowing who did it. People started getting angry and suspicious of others. Many people hacked each other as a form of revenge and soon the countries had to disable the Internet.
People went to the old ways of having fun. Neighbours played chess and checkers in the corridors and little children played in the playgrounds and bouncy castles. Everything went well for a few months. Then, some people requested for the Internet to be restarted. The government agreed but put many firewalls in place.
