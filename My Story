The year is 2153. Life in Singapore still looks the same as before in 2020, when the virus attacked us. Maybe it is partly because nobody bothered to do anything. There were no flying cars, no hoverboards, no floating islands, no iPhone 30 and no PS10. It still look like the same thing with the skyscrapers, cars on the roads, planes in the skies and ships in the water. Nobody invented or researched something new to help society as they were just obsessed with making money. Thus, society remained the same.
 Anyway, I digress. I am just a young student named Percy and I am tasked to write how life is like in 2153. This is my weighted assessment and I must score well with this essay. I am supposed to be writing to a student of my age in 2020. That would be you, I suppose.
